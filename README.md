# Places API
 
The application exposes both a Rest API (for programmatic access) and a web user interface (admin) for place management. The main packages I used are Flask and SQLAlchemy. For API Testing I used Postman API.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone your GitHub repository to your local machine. You can do this by using the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` and `your-repo` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**

   Navigate to the cloned repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   While the virtual environment is active, install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask App:**

   Now you can run the Flask app:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Flask app should start running, and you'll see output indicating that the development server is running.

5. **Access the App:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or `http://localhost:5000/`). You should see the output of your running Flask app.
